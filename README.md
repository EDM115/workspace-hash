## :memo: Features
:runner: **Fast** : Runs in huge monorepos [in no time](#rocket-benchmarks), processes workspaces in parallel  
:dart: **Accurate** : Generates hashes based on every tracked file  
:left_right_arrow: **Complete** : Supports transitive workspace dependencies  
:ok_hand: **No config** : Drop-in and instantly usable  
:computer: **Cross-platform** : Works on Windows, Linux and macOS  
:hash: **Deterministic** : Same input, same output  
:package: **Lightweight** : No bloat, just the essentials

</div>

## :thinking: Why
When you're working with monorepos, there's often a lot of workspaces (packages) that end up being created.  
And as your project grows, so does the number of workspaces (and so does your build times...).  
If you ever worked with stuff like Next.js, you know what I'm talking about. And since every workspace requires another, you need everything to be built to test your changes.

Although there are tools that allow your scripts to run only when files have changed (ex `turbo`), the complete CI step cannot benefit from this. For example with `turbo` again, they allow you to prune just the right workspaces and dependencies when building in a Docker, but this requires copying the entire monorepo into the container so we can't benefit from Docker's layers caching.  
If only there could be a way to determine if a workspace hasn't changed to not rebuild it for nothing...

Well lucky you, `monorepo-hash` is here to help with that !

> [!NOTE]
> `monorepo-hash` was created when I was doing my internship at Nexelec.  
> I really put a lot of energy in this script so I decided to release `monorepo-hash` as a standalone CLI tool to help anyone struggling with this problem !

## :beginner: Usage
### Installation
You can install `monorepo-hash` globally, but it's best to add it as a dev dependency at the root of your monorepo :
```bash
pnpm add -D monorepo-hash
```
> [!TIP]  
> Make sure that the `packages` field in your `pnpm-workspace.yaml` file is set up correctly, as `monorepo-hash` will use it to find your workspaces. Globs are supported.  
> `monorepo-hash` will also use the `workspace:` field in your `package.json` files to detect transitive dependencies.  
> Finally, it will generate `.hash` files that you would need to keep in your VCS in order for it to be efficient (ex : to be reused in your CI).

### Get help
```bash
pnpm monorepo-hash --help
```
> [!TIP]  
> Short versions of all arguments are also available.

### Generate hashes for your entire monorepo
```bash
pnpm monorepo-hash --generate
```

### Generate hashes for specific workspaces
Specify them in quotes, separated by commas, no spaces, and with no leading or trailing slashes.  
The target name is the path to the workspace relative to the root of your monorepo, and uses forward slashes no matter your platform.
```bash
pnpm monorepo-hash --generate --target="packages/example,services/ui"
```

### Compare hashes
```bash
pnpm monorepo-hash --compare
```

### Compare hashes for specific workspaces
Same rules apply.
```bash
pnpm monorepo-hash --compare --target="packages/example"
```

### Run in silent mode
This will suppress all output except for errors. This can be useful for example in CI where only the exit code matters.
```bash
pnpm monorepo-hash --compare --silent
```

### Run in debug mode
The debug mode will :
- in generate mode, output `.debug-hash` files which will contain the hashes of each individual file in the workspace as a JSON object
- in compare mode, read those `.debug-hash` files and tell you *exactly* which files have changed in each workspace, and what their hashes are  
This can be useful to check why the hashes appear to be different, or to debug issues with the hashes generation.
```bash
pnpm monorepo-hash --generate --debug
# later on...
pnpm monorepo-hash --compare --debug
```
Don't forget to delete these files afterwards !

### Exit codes
- `0` : No changes detected (or you wanted to get help)
- `1` : Changes detected in the hashes
- `2` : Error with the arguments (either `--generate` or `--compare` is missing, or both were provided)
- `3` : Unknown arguments provided
- `4` : No workspaces found, either the `pnpm-workspace.yaml` file is missing or the `packages` field is not set up correctly
- `5` : An unexpected error occurred, please open an issue with the logs

## :test_tube: Examples

### Usage in CI
This was the main reason I created this tool, and whether it's in GitHub Actions or locally through [act](https://github.com/nektos/act), it can help you to reduce drastically CI times.

</details>

Here we use the actions cache to store the `.hash` files, so that we can reuse them in the next runs.  
This is especially useful because when you generate hashes, the action will pick them up from the latest commit and not the latest run.  
For the very first run, you might need to create a workflow which will only checkout and save the .hash files in a cache for future runs.

## :construction: Limitations
- Supports `PNPM`, `Yarn`, `NPM`, `Bun` and `Deno`
- Bases the transitive dependency detection on the `workspace:` field in the `package.json` files
- If you use another Version Control System than `git`, we can't ignore your files correctly for the hashes generation
- Your EOL (End of Line) should be consistent across your monorepo's files and the different environments it's being used in. Since Docker containers and GitHub Actions runners are based on Linux, it's recommended to use `LF` as EOL.  
  I recommend to set this up in your IDE and formatter config.

## :rocket: Benchmarks
These benchmarks have been realised on Standard GitHub-hosted runner that you can get by running any Action.  
The specs as I'm wroting this are an AMD EPYC 7763 64-Core (4) @ 3.24 GHz CPU, 15.62 GiB of RAM and 71.61 GiB of SSD storage.  
They have been reproduced 10 times with a cold disk cache thanks to [hyperfine](https://github.com/sharkdp/hyperfine).  
Warm cache usage is usually 2/3 times faster than cold cache, so these results are more representative of a first run in CI or on a fresh boot. The script run speed doesn't really change, the only performance overhead on a cold cache is the time it takes to run Node.js (and reading files from the disk).
> [!NOTE]  
> Here are the details of each demo monorepo used for the benchmarks :
> - **Small monorepo** : 5 workspaces of 100 files each, files composed of 1 line of text
> - **Medium monorepo** : 5 workspaces of 100 folders each, with each folder containing 100 files, files composed of 10 lines of text
> - **Large monorepo** : 5 workspaces of 100 folders each, with each folder containing 10 files and 10 folders, and each of these folders containing 100 files, files composed of 100 lines of text
